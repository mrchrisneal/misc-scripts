# Network Failover Script User Guide

## IMPORTANT UPDATE:
As of June 11th, 2025, the current iteration of this script does not work as expected in testing. If you'd like to use and improve this script yourself, please feel free to do so. Run this script at your own risk!

## Overview

The NetworkFailover.ps1 script automatically switches between your primary internet connection and a backup connection when your main connection fails. When your primary connection goes down, the script enables your mobile device's USB hotspot and switches back when the main connection returns.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 operating system
- PowerShell
- Administrator privileges
- Mobile device with USB tethering capability
- Both network adapters must be present in your system

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Your Network Adapters

Before configuring the script, you need to identify the exact names of your network adapters:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   Get-NetAdapter | Format-Table Name, InterfaceDescription
   ```
3. Note the `InterfaceDescription` values for both your:
   - Primary network adapter (e.g., "Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160MHz")
   - Backup/mobile device adapter (e.g., "Apple Mobile Device Ethernet")

### Step 2: Configure the Script

Open the NetworkFailover.ps1 script in a text editor and modify the following parameters:

1. `$PrimaryAdapterDescription` - Set this to match your primary network adapter description
2. `$BackupAdapterDescription` - Set this to match your mobile device adapter description

Optional configuration parameters:
- `$FailureThreshold` - Number of consecutive ping failures before switching (default: 4)
- `$CheckInterval` - Seconds between connectivity checks (default: 1)
- `$RestoreDelay` - Seconds to wait before switching back to primary (default: 5)
- `$TestHosts` - IP addresses to test connectivity against

### Step 3: Save the Script

Save the script in a permanent location such as:
```
C:\Tools\NetworkFailover.ps1
```

## Running the Script

### Manual Execution

1. Connect your mobile device via USB
2. Open PowerShell as Administrator
3. Navigate to the script location:
   ```
   cd C:\Tools
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```
   .\NetworkFailover.ps1
   ```

For detailed troubleshooting information, add the `-Debug` flag:
```
.\NetworkFailover.ps1 -Debug
```

### Automatic Startup (Not Recommended)

To make the script run automatically at system startup:

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create a new task:
   - Run with highest privileges
   - Trigger: At system startup
   - Action: Start a program
   - Program: powershell.exe
   - Arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Tools\NetworkFailover.ps1"`

## Troubleshooting

### Execution Policy Errors

If you receive an error about execution policy, use one of these solutions:

- Temporary solution (safest):
  ```
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Tools\NetworkFailover.ps1"
  ```

- User-level solution:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
  ```

- System-wide solution:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope LocalMachine RemoteSigned
  ```

### Adapter Not Found

If the script can't find your adapters:

1. Run the command to see available adapters:
   ```
   Get-NetAdapter | Format-Table Name, InterfaceDescription
   ```
2. Update the script parameters to match your exact adapter descriptions

### USB Device Not Connected

The mobile device must be connected via USB before starting the script. Make sure:
- The phone is connected before running the script
- USB tethering is enabled on your device
- You're using a data cable (not just a charging cable)

## Important Notes

- The script must run with Administrator privileges
- Your mobile device must be connected via USB when the script starts
- The script continuously monitors your internet connection
- To stop the script, press Ctrl+C in the PowerShell window
